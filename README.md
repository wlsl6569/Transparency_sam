# Transparency_sam

To support our experiments, we constructed a custom synthetic dataset that reflects real-world scenarios by varying environments and viewing angles.  
This dataset was built using the **TransPose** dataset, which provides images and 3D models of transparent equipment and objects.  
These 3D models were imported into **Unreal Engine** to generate a total of **4,350** paired RGB images and corresponding ground truth segmentation maps.

The dataset is split into:

- **Train**: 3,045 images  
- **Validation**: 652 images  
- **Test**: 653 images
